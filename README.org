* Preact Wasm
  It is a port of [[https://preactjs.com/][PreactJs]] written in [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]]. The intention
  of this project is to provide a compatible alternative to
  React in [[https://webassembly.org/][WebAssembly]] that woks with existing projects
  written in javascript/typescript.

* Contributing
  This project will use [[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow][gitflow]], to make it easier you can
  install the [[https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/wiki/Installation][tools]].

  Required software:
  - [[https://rustup.rs/][Rustup]]
  - [[https://www.npmjs.com/][npm]]
  - [[https://git-scm.com/][git]]

  While it is not strictly necessary, it is *highly* recommended
  to have an UNIX like OS such as Linux or (sight) OSX and an editor
  that supports [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rls][Rust Language Server]] (RLS) such as emacs, vscode,
  atom, etc.

  To start, you will need to install the wasm target and the
  wasm-bindgen tool.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
  cargo +nightly install wasm-bindgen-cli
  #+END_SRC
